## How to Run the Project in One Go

This project has been configured to run both the frontend and backend in one go, making it easy to get started.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- MongoDB running locally or a MongoDB Atlas connection

### Quick Start (Windows)

1. Simply double-click the `start-project.bat` file
2. The script will:
   - Install any missing dependencies
   - Build the React frontend
   - Start the server which serves both frontend and backend

### Quick Start (Mac/Linux)

1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Make the script executable (if not already):
   ```bash
   chmod +x start-project.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./start-project.sh
   ```

### Manual Start

If you prefer to run commands manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
npm run client-install

# Build and start
npm run start-all
```

Once running, access the application at: http://localhost:5000

## Development Mode

If you're actively developing and want hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the backend (http://localhost:5000) and frontend (http://localhost:3000) in development mode with hot reloading.
